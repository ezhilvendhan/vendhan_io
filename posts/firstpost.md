This is my First Personal Blog and my first post.

I decided to write and share regularly on the things I work. It feels great to start a personal website. Though you might have created websites for clients, its a great feeling to create one for you.

I hack things and look forward to write on Javascript, Go, HTML, CSS and other technologies. I am also a practising Zen Buddhist and so you can find a few words on that.
