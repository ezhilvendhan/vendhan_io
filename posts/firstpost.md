This is my First Personal Blog and my first post.

It feels great to start a personal website. Though you might have created websites for clients, its exciting to create one for you.
I hack things and look forward to write on Javascript, Go, HTML, CSS...

Did I mention the name of the blog? Its **Hakuin's Monkey**[[?]](http://shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3942&Itemid=0).
[Hakuin Ekaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku) was a great Zen Master from 18th Century who revived Rinzai Zen and systematized the Koan practice. The blog's title is from his poem *The Monkey is Reaching*.

The verse goes like this:

```
The monkey is reaching
For the moon in the water.
Until death overtakes him
He’ll never give up.
If he’d let go the branch and
Disappear in the deep pool,
The whole world would shine
With dazzling pureness
```

This is one of my favourite poems and the monkey is no alien. Hence the name!

I am one among the students of [Zen Master Fr. AMA Samy](http://www.bodhizendo.org/). I am very thankful to him
for confirming the name of this blog. He is the only Zen Master in India who is ordained to teach Zen.
He teaches both Rinzai and Soto Zen and gives lectures in Europe, America & Australia. In case you are
