Creating a personal site is pretty easy these days with the availability of a gamut of tools and services.

While deciding on the platform, nodejs was my obvious choice. The reason being its simplicity, my prior experience and the vibrant community. I opted to go with koajs, the reason being the usage of ES6 generators. Moreover, koa is very lighter than express.

I was firm not to opt any client-side frameworks. I like markdown and used marked library to parse them to HTML.
For task automation, gulp is my natural choice due to its streaming and asynchronous tasks. I used Compass for CSS authoring.

I love the swig templates and have used it throughout.
