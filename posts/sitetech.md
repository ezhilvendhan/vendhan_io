Creating a personal site is pretty easy these days with the availability of a variety of tools and services. I am a Web Developer with experience in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java. So, I naturally prefer something with a heavy javascript flavour.

While deciding on the platform, nodejs was my obvious choice. The reason being its simplicity, my prior experience and the vibrant community. With such a great community support, you can't go wrong on nodejs!

For the server-side middleware, I opted to go with [koajs](http://koajs.com/). The reason being the usage of ES6 features like generators, its more lighter than express. I will be using markdown to write posts. I used [marked](https://npmjs.org/package/marked) library to convert the markdowns to html. I want more learning experience and hence not opted for any blog generators.

Coming to the frontend, I have used [browserify](http://browserify.org/). I am not a fan of frameworks, so I decided to go with vanilla javascript. [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) was very useful for CSS authoring.

Task automation is cool and very simple with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com). Streams make it very powerful. Now comes the domain & hosting. [GANDI](http://gandi.net) is an excellent place to buy your domain. Go for it! For hosting the nodejs app, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is highly recommended.
